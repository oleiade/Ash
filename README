Ash -- A.K.A "Another Shell"  is yet another Unix shell in spirit to Zsh or Bash.

Realized while a school project, It's not intending to reinvent the wheel, I rather consider it as a Sandbox. 
A lightweight Shell, implementing classical and minimal functionalities such as auto-completion, 
history, env and path management, config file management and so on. 

It is based on C language and implements termcaps tty management and a LL Parser in order
to manage command parsing. Some "Great features" are missing for the moment, such as
gobbling or scripting implementation; but it was conceived in a "Keep it simple" way.
